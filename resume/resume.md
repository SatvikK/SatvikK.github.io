## Research Experience

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Interpretable AI for diagnosing breast cancer
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Summer 2022–Present</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Building convolutional neural networks with additional prototype layers.  
- These models provide diagnoses on malignancy of breast tissue along with informing the physician why the model has made the prediction.

</p>
My role at St. John's included ideating research proposals, performing analyses, and publishing and presenting results from different projects.

- Modeling potential impacts of improved monthly income on child stunting in India — a geospatial perspective
    - Raised $100,00 awarded by the Gates Foundation and the Government of India as part of The Grand Challenges - India.
    - The aim was to help policymakers identify optimal strategies to reduce child undernutrition (stunting) in India.
    - Trained and applied Gaussian Process Regressions Models to calculate small-area estimates of stunting prevalence and potential benefits.
    - Tools used: Python, PyTorch, GPyTorch
- Protein-quality evaluation of complementary foods in Indian children
    - Tested statistical differences in digestibility across multiple amino acids in a clinical research experiment.
    - Estimated digestibility corrected Amino Acid intake scores for states of India. Tested for associations with child growth failure.
- Nutrition Value chain Data Repository
    - Collated, preprocessed, and set up a centralized database of about 100+ harmonized datasets across the nutrition value chain (crop production to health outcomes through distribution, purchase, consumption, and absorption.
    - Built a dashboard for easy exploration and extraction of the data for the Institute.

## Projects

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Brain Tumor Segmentation
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Built Image Segmentation Neural Network Models (U-net) that scan 3-dimensional brain MRI images and identiy regions of brain associated with a tumor.
- The model can be used to aid neurosurgeons to precisely locate damaged regions in the brain.

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Optimizing CT scan slice count through Lesion detection using YOLO
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Simulated CT imaging on images of lesions to create images that would have been obtained from lower resolution CT Scanning.
- Optimzed number of CT slices required during imaging that allow acceptable object detection capabilities on Object-Detection Neural Network Models while minimizing costs.

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Does Airbnb listing’s annual revenue vary by with host status?
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Analyzed AirBnb data from American cities to determine if superhosts are able to generate more revenue than regular hosts.
- Used Causal Inference principles to balance data and determined that superhosts are indeed more profitable.

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    AWS Cloud Tweet Generator
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Fall 2021</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Built and deployed a end-to-end cloud-based data pipeline that generates tweets everyday relevant to current trending topics.
- The pipeline collects and cleans tweets everyday for training data and then re-trains and deploys a generative LDA model.
- Used AWS services: Lambda, S3, EC2, ECR, and Batch. The pipeline was deployed using Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK).

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Star Trek: Analysis of Episodes
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Fall 2021</i>
    </span>
</p>

- A statistical analysis of IMDb data from four star trek TV shows to evaluate which characters are perceived more favourably.
- Engineered features from script data to create a proxy for character-screentime in each episode.
