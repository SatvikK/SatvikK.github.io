## Projects

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    Brain Tumor Segmentation
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Built Image Segmentation Neural Network Models (U-net) that scan 3-dimensional brain MRI images and identiy regions of brain associated with a tumor.
- The model can be used to aid neurosurgeons to precisely locate damaged regions in the brain.

    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Simulated CT imaging on images of lesions to create images that would have been obtained from lower resolution CT Scanning.
- Optimzed number of CT slices required during imaging that allow acceptable object detection capabilities on Object-Detection Neural Network Models while minimizing costs.

    Does Airbnb listing’s annual revenue vary by with host status?
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Spring 2022</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Analyzed AirBnb data from American cities to determine if superhosts are able to generate more revenue than regular hosts.
- Used Causal Inference principles to balance data and determined that superhosts are indeed more profitable.

<p style="text-align:left;margin:0; padding-top:0;">
    AWS Cloud Tweet Generator
    <span style="float:right; margin-bottom:0;">
        <i>Fall 2021</i>
    </span>
</p>

- Built and deployed a end-to-end cloud-based data pipeline that generates tweets everyday relevant to current trending topics.
- The pipeline collects and cleans tweets everyday for training data and then re-trains and deploys a generative LDA model.
- Used AWS services: Lambda, S3, EC2, ECR, and Batch. The pipeline was deployed using Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK).
